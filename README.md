EmbedAnything is a minimalist, highly performant, lightning-fast, lightweight, multisource, multimodal, and local embedding pipeline built in Rust. Whether you're working with text, images, audio, PDFs, websites, or other media, EmbedAnything streamlines the process of generating embeddings from various sources and seamlessly streaming (memory-efficient-indexing) them to a vector database. It supports dense, sparse, ONNX and late-interaction embeddings, offering flexibility for a wide range of use cases.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Local Embedding** : Works with local embedding models like BERT and JINA
- **ONNX Models**: Works with ONNX models for BERT and ColPali
- **ColPali** : Support for ColPali in GPU version
- **Splade** : Support for sparse embeddings for hybrid
- **Cloud Embedding Models:**: Supports OpenAI and Cohere.  
- **MultiModality** : Works with text sources like PDFs, txt, md, Images JPG and Audio, .WAV
- **Rust** : All the file processing is done in rust for speed and efficiency
- **Candle** : We have taken care of hardware acceleration as well, with Candle.
- **Python Interface:** Packaged as a Python library for seamless integration into your existing projects.
- **Vector Streaming:** Continuously create and stream embeddings if you have low resource.

## üí°What is Vector Streaming

Vector Streaming enables you to process and generate embeddings for files and stream them, so if you have 10 GB of file, it can continuously generate embeddings Chunk by Chunk, that you can segment semantically, and store them in the vector database of your choice, Thus it eliminates bulk embeddings storage on RAM at once.

# ‚≠ê Supported Models

We support any hugging-face models on Candle. And We also support ONNX runtime for BERT and ColPali.

## How to add custom model on candle: from_pretrained_hf
```python
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_hf(
    WhichModel.Bert, model_id="model link from huggingface"
)
config = TextEmbedConfig(chunk_size=200, batch_size=32)
data = embed_anything.embed_file("file_address", embeder=model, config=config)
```


| Model  | Custom link |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Jina  | jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en  |
|   | jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en  |
| Bert | sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 |
|      | sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2 |
|      | sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 |
| Clip | openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 | 
| Whisper| Most OpenAI Whisper from huggingface supported.


## Splade Models:

```
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_hf(
    WhichModel.SparseBert, "prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1"
)
```

## ONNX-Runtime: from_pretrained_onnx

### BERT

```
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_onnx(
  WhichModel.Bert, model_id="onnx_model_link"
)
```

### ColPali

```
model: ColpaliModel = ColpaliModel.from_pretrained_onnx("starlight-ai/colpali-v1.2-merged-onnx", None)
```

## For Semantic Chunking

```python
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_hf(
    WhichModel.Bert, model_id="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2"
)

# with semantic encoder
semantic_encoder = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_hf(WhichModel.Jina, model_id = "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en")
config = TextEmbedConfig(chunk_size=256, batch_size=32, splitting_strategy = "semantic", semantic_encoder=semantic_encoder)

```



# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Getting Started

## üíö Installation

`
pip install embed-anything
`<br/>

For GPUs and using special models like ColPali <br/>

`
pip install embed-anything-gpu
`



# Usage



## ‚û°Ô∏è Usage For 0.3 and later version


### To use local embedding: we support Bert and Jina

```python
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_local(
    WhichModel.Bert, model_id="Hugging_face_link"
)
data = embed_anything.embed_file("test_files/test.pdf", embeder=model)
```



## For multimodal embedding: we support CLIP
### Requirements Directory with pictures you want to search for example we have test_files with images of cat, dogs etc

```python
import embed_anything
from embed_anything import EmbedData
model = embed_anything.EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_local(
    embed_anything.WhichModel.Clip,
    model_id="openai/clip-vit-base-patch16",
    # revision="refs/pr/15",
)
data: list[EmbedData] = embed_anything.embed_directory("test_files", embeder=model)
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
query = ["Photo of a monkey?"]
query_embedding = np.array(
    embed_anything.embed_query(query, embeder=model)[0].embedding
)
similarities = np.dot(embeddings, query_embedding)
max_index = np.argmax(similarities)
Image.open(data[max_index].text).show()
```

## Audio Embedding using Whisper
### requirements:  Audio .wav files.


```python
import embed_anything
from embed_anything import (
    AudioDecoderModel,
    EmbeddingModel,
    embed_audio_file,
    TextEmbedConfig,
)
# choose any whisper or distilwhisper model from https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper or https://huggingface.co/collections/openai/whisper-release-6501bba2cf999715fd953013
audio_decoder = AudioDecoderModel.from_pretrained_hf(
    "openai/whisper-tiny.en", revision="main", model_type="tiny-en", quantized=False
)
embeder = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_hf(
    embed_anything.WhichModel.Bert,
    model_id="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    revision="main",
)
config = TextEmbedConfig(chunk_size=200, batch_size=32)
data = embed_anything.embed_audio_file(
    "test_files/audio/samples_hp0.wav",
    audio_decoder=audio_decoder,
    embeder=embeder,
    text_embed_config=config,
)
print(data[0].metadata)

```

# üèéÔ∏è RoadMap 

## Accomplishments

One of the aims of EmbedAnything is to allow AI engineers to easily use state of the art embedding models on typical files and documents. A lot has already been accomplished here and these are the formats that we support right now and a few more have to be done. <br />

### üñºÔ∏è Modalities and Source

We‚Äôre excited to share that we've expanded our platform to support multiple modalities, including:

- [x] Audio files

- [x] Markdowns

- [x] Websites

- [x] Images

- [ ] Videos

- [ ] Graph

This gives you the flexibility to work with various data types all in one place! üåê <br />

### üíú Product
We‚Äôve rolled out some major updates in version 0.3 to improve both functionality and performance. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:

- Semantic Chunking: Optimized chunking strategy for better Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.

- Streaming for Efficient Indexing: We‚Äôve introduced streaming for memory-efficient indexing in vector databases. Want to know more? Check out our article on this feature here: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/09/vector-streaming/

- Zero-Shot Applications: Explore our zero-shot application demos to see the power of these updates in action.

- Intuitive Functions: Version 0.3 includes a complete refactor for more intuitive functions, making the platform easier to use.

- Chunkwise Streaming: Instead of file-by-file streaming, we now support chunkwise streaming, allowing for more flexible and efficient data processing.

Check out the latest release :  and see how these features can supercharge your GenerativeAI pipeline! ‚ú®

## üöÄComing Soon  <br />

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance 
We've received quite a few questions about why we're using Candle, so here's a quick explanation:

One of the main reasons is that Candle doesn't require any specific ONNX format models, which means it can work seamlessly with any Hugging Face model. This flexibility has been a key factor for us. However, we also recognize that we‚Äôve been compromising a bit on speed in favor of that flexibility.

What‚Äôs Next?
To address this, we‚Äôre excited to announce that we‚Äôre introducing Candle-ONNX along with our previous framework on hugging-face ,

‚û°Ô∏è Support for GGUF models </br >
- Significantly faster performance</br >
- Stay tuned for these exciting updates! üöÄ</br >


### ü´êEmbeddings:

We had multimodality from day one for our infrastructure. We have already included it for websites, images and audios but we want to expand it further to.

‚òëÔ∏èGraph embedding -- build deepwalks embeddings depth first and word to vec <br />
‚òëÔ∏èVideo Embedding <br/>
‚òëÔ∏è Yolo Clip <br/>


### üåäExpansion to other Vector Adapters

We currently support a wide range of vector databases for streaming embeddings, including:

- Elastic: thanks to amazing and active Elastic team for the contribution <br/>
- Weaviate<br/>
- Pinecone<br/>


But we're not stopping there! We're actively working to expand this list.

Want to Contribute?
If you‚Äôd like to add support for your favorite vector database, we‚Äôd love to have your help! Check out our contribution.md for guidelines, or feel free to reach out directly starlight-search@proton.me. Let's build something amazing together! üí°
