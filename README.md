EmbedAnything is a powerful python library designed to streamline the creation and management of embedding pipelines. Whether you're working with text, images, audio, or any other type of data., EmbedAnything makes it easy to generate embeddings from multiple sources and store them efficiently in a vector database.

## 🦀The Benefit of Rust for Speed
By using Rust for its core functionalities, EmbedAnything offers significant speed advantages:
Rust is Compiled: Unlike Python, Rust compiles directly to machine code, resulting in faster execution.
Memory Management: Rust enforces memory management simultaneously, preventing memory leaks and crashes that can plague other languages.
Rust achieves true multithreading.

## 🚀Why Candle?...
Running language models or embedding models locally can be difficult, especially when you want to deploy a product that utilizes these models. If you use the transformers library from Hugging Face in Python, you will depend on PyTorch for tensor operations. This, in turn, has a dependency on Libtorch, which means that you will need to include the entire Libtorch library with your product. Also, Candle allows inferences on CUDA-enabled GPUs right out of the box. We will soon post on how we use Candle to increase the performance and decrease the memory usage of EmbedAnything.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Local Embedding** Works with local embedding models like AllminiLM
- **MultiModality** Works with text and image and will soon expand to audio
- **Python Interface:** Packaged as a Python library for seamless integration into your existing projects.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for speed and performance, with core functionality written in Rust.
- **Scalable:** Store embeddings in a vector database for easy retrieval and scalability.
- **OpenAI** Works with openai as well




## 💚 Installation

`
pip install embed-anything`





# 🧑‍🚀 Getting Started

## For local models 

### To use local embedding: we support Bert and Jina

```python
import embed_anything
data = embed_anything.embed_file("filename.pdf", embeder= "Bert")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
```


## For multimodal embedding: we support CLIP
### Requirements Directory with pictures you want to search for example we have test_files with images of cat, dogs etc

```python
import embed_anything
data = embed_anything.embed_directory("test_files", embeder= "Clip")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])

query = "photo of a dog"
query_embedding = np.array(embed_anything.embed_query(query, embeder= "Clip")[0].embedding)
similarities = np.dot(embeddings, query_embedding)
max_index = np.argmax(similarities)
Image.open(data[max_index].text).show()
```


## For OpenAI 
1. Please check if you already have the OpenAI key in the Environment variable.

### If you are using embed-anything==0.1.7 version (latest version)

```python
import embed_anything
data = embed_anything.embed_file("filename.pdf", embeder= "OpenAI")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
```
