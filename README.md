EmbedAnything is a minimalist, yet highly performant, modular, lightning-fast, lightweight, multisource, multimodal, and local embedding pipeline built in Rust. Whether you're working with text, images, audio, PDFs, websites, or other media, EmbedAnything streamlines the process of generating embeddings from various sources and seamlessly streaming (memory-efficient-indexing) them to a vector database. It supports dense, sparse, ONNX, model2vec and late-interaction embeddings, offering flexibility for a wide range of use cases.

## üí°What is Vector Streaming

 Embedding models are computationally expensive and time-consuming. By separating document preprocessing from model inference, you can significantly reduce pipeline latency and improve throughput.

Vector streaming transforms a sequential bottleneck into an efficient, concurrent workflow.

The embedding process happens separetly from the main process, so as to maintain high performance enabled by rust MPSC, and no memory leak as embeddings are directly saved to vector database. Find our [blog](https://starlight-search.com/blog/2025/02/25/vector%20database/).

`
pip install embed-anything
`<br/>

For GPUs and using special models like ColPali <br/>

`
pip install embed-anything-gpu
`

üöß‚ùå If it shows cuda error while running on windowns, run the following command:

# Usage

## ‚û°Ô∏è Usage For 0.3 and later version

```python
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_local(
    WhichModel.Bert, model_id="Hugging_face_link"
)
data = embed_anything.embed_file("test_files/test.pdf", embedder=model)
```



### Using ONNX Models

To use ONNX models, you can either use the `ONNXModel` enum or the `model_id` from the Hugging Face model.


Using the above method is best to ensure that the model works correctly as these models are tested. But if you want to use other models, like finetuned models, you can use the `hf_model_id` and `path_in_repo` to load the model like below.

```python
model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_onnx(
  WhichModel.Jina, hf_model_id = "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en", path_in_repo="model.onnx"
)
```
To see all the ONNX models supported with model_name, see [here](/docs/guides/onnx_models.md)

## ‚ÅâÔ∏èFAQ

### Do I need to know rust to use or contribute to embedanything?
The answer is No. EmbedAnything provides you pyo3 bindings, so you can run any function in python without any issues. To contibute you should check out our guidelines and python folder example of adapters.

### How is it different from fastembed?

We provide both backends, candle and onnx. On top of it we also give an end-to-end pipeline, that is you can ingest different data-types and index to any vector database, and inference any model. Fastembed is just an onnx-wrapper.

### We've received quite a few questions about why we're using Candle.

One of the main reasons is that Candle doesn't require any specific ONNX format models, which means it can work seamlessly with any Hugging Face model. This flexibility has been a key factor for us. However, we also recognize that we‚Äôve been compromising a bit on speed in favor of that flexibility.

# üèéÔ∏è RoadMap 

## Accomplishments

One of the aims of EmbedAnything is to allow AI engineers to easily use state of the art embedding models on typical files and documents. A lot has already been accomplished here and these are the formats that we support right now and a few more have to be done. <br />


### üñºÔ∏è Modalities and Source

We‚Äôre excited to share that we've expanded our platform to support multiple modalities, including:

- [x] Audio files

- [x] Markdowns

- [x] Websites

- [x] Images

- [ ] Videos

- [ ] Graph

This gives you the flexibility to work with various data types all in one place! üåê <br />

We now support both candle and Onnx backend<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è Support for GGUF models </br >


### ü´êEmbeddings:

We had multimodality from day one for our infrastructure. We have already included it for websites, images and audios but we want to expand it further to.

‚û°Ô∏è Video Embedding <br/>
‚û°Ô∏è Yolo Clip <br/>


### üåäExpansion to other Vector Adapters

We currently support a wide range of vector databases for streaming embeddings, including:
