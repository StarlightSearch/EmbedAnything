Introducing vector streaming in EmbedAnything, a feature designed to optimize large-scale document embedding. By enabling asynchronous chunking and embedding using Rust’s concurrency, it reduces memory usage and speeds up the process. We also show how to integrate it with the Weaviate Vector Database for seamless image embedding and search.

In my previous article [Supercharge Your Embeddings Pipeline with EmbedAnything](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/06/supercharge-your-embeddings-pipeline-with-embedanything/), I discussed the idea behind EmbedAnything and how it makes creating embeddings from multiple modalities easy. In this article, I want to introduce a new feature of EmbedAnything called vector streaming and see how it works with Weaviate Vector Database. 

### What is the problem?

First, let's examine the current problem with creating embeddings, especially in large-scale documents. The current embedding frameworks operate on a two-step process: chunking and embedding. First, the text is extracted from all the files, and chunks/nodes are created. Then, these chunks are fed to an embedding model with a specific batch size to process the embeddings. While this is done, the chunks and the embeddings stay on the system memory. This is not a problem when the files are small, and the embedding dimensions are small. But this becomes a problem when there are many files and you are working with large models and, even worse, multi-vector embeddings. Thus, to work with this, a high RAM is required to process the embeddings. Also, if this is done synchronously, a lot of time is wasted while the chunks are being created, as chunking is not a compute-heavy operation. As the chunks are being made, passing them to the embedding model would be efficient. 

### Our Solution

The solution is to create an asynchronous chunking and embedding task. We can effectively spawn threads to handle this task using Rust's concurrency patterns and thread safety. This is done using Rust's MPSC (Multi-producer Single Consumer) module, which passes messages between threads. Thus, this creates a stream of chunks passed into the embedding thread with a buffer. Once the buffer is complete, it embeds the chunks and sends the embeddings back to the main thread, where they are sent to the vector database. This ensures no time is wasted on a single operation and no bottlenecks. Moreover, only the chunks and embeddings in the buffer are stored in the system memory. They are erased from the memory once moved to the vector database.

### Example Use Case

Now, let's see this feature in action. 

With EmbedAnything, streaming the vectors from a directory of files to the vector database is a simple three-step process. 

1. **Create an adapter for your vector database:** This is a wrapper around the database's functions that allows you to create an index, convert metadata from EmbedAnything's format to the format required by the database, and the function to insert the embeddings in the index. Adapters for the prominent databases are already created and present [here](https://github.com/StarlightSearch/EmbedAnything/tree/main/examples/adapters): 

2. **Initiate an embedding model of your choice:** You can choose from different local models or even cloud models. The configuration can also be determined to set the chunk size and buffer size for how many embeddings need to be streamed at once. Ideally, this should be as high as possible, but the system RAM limits this. 

3. **Call the embedding function from EmbedAnything:** Just pass the directory path to be embedded, the embedding model, the adapter, and the configuration. 

In this example, we will embed a directory of images and send it to the vector databases. 

#### Step 1: Create the Adapter

In EmbedAnything, the adapters are created outside so as to not make the library heavy and you get to choose which database you want to work with. Here is a simple adapter for Weaviate.

```python
from embed_anything import EmbedData
from embed_anything.vectordb import Adapter

class WeaviateAdapter(Adapter):
    def __init__(self, api_key, url):
        super().__init__(api_key)
        self.client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
            cluster_url=url, auth_credentials=wvc.init.Auth.api_key(api_key)
        )
        if self.client.is_ready():
            print("Weaviate is ready")

    def create_index(self, index_name: str):
        self.index_name = index_name
        self.collection = self.client.collections.create(
            index_name, vectorizer_config=wvc.config.Configure.Vectorizer.none()
        )
        return self.collection

    def convert(self, embeddings: List[EmbedData]):
        data = []
        for embedding in embeddings:
            property = embedding.metadata
            property["text"] = embedding.text
            data.append(
                wvc.data.DataObject(properties=property, vector=embedding.embedding)
            )
        return data

    def upsert(self, embeddings):
        data = self.convert(embeddings)
        self.client.collections.get(self.index_name).data.insert_many(data)

    def delete_index(self, index_name: str):
        self.client.collections.delete(index_name)

### Start the client and index

URL = "your-weaviate-url"
API_KEY = "your-weaviate-api-key"
weaviate_adapter = WeaviateAdapter(API_KEY, URL)

index_name = "Test_index"
if index_name in weaviate_adapter.client.collections.list_all():
    weaviate_adapter.delete_index(index_name)
weaviate_adapter.create_index("Test_index")
```


#### Step 2: Create the Embedding Model 

Here, since we are embedding images, we can use the clip model 

```python
import embed_anything import WhichModel

model = embed_anything.EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained_cloud(
        embed_anything.WhichModel.Clip,     
        model_id="openai/clip-vit-base-patch16")

```

#### Step 3: Embed the Directory

```python

data = embed_anything.embed_image_directory(
    "\image_directory",
    embeder=model,
    adapter=weaviate_adapter,
    config=embed_anything.ImageEmbedConfig(buffer_size=100),
)

```

#### Step 4: Query the Vector Database

```python
query_vector = embed_anything.embed_query(["image of a cat"], embeder=model)[0].embedding
```

#### Step 5: Query the Vector Database

```python
response = weaviate_adapter.collection.query.near_vector(
    near_vector=query_vector,
    limit=2,
    return_metadata=wvc.query.MetadataQuery(certainty=True),
)
```

### Conclusion

We think vector streaming is one of the features that will empower many engineers to opt for a more optimized and no-tech debt solution. Instead of using bulky frameworks on the cloud, you can use a lightweight streaming option.
