# COUNTER AFFIDAVIT OF THE FIRST RESPONDENT/ STATE OF TAMIL NADU  

I, K.Rajaraman, son of G.Kalyanaraman, Hindu, aged about 52 years, residing at No.F-6, 6th Floor, Triumph Apartments, No.114, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Arumbakkam, Chennai - 600 106, Tamil Nadu, do hereby solemnly affirm and sincerely state as follows:  

1. I am the Principal Secretary to the Government, State of Tamil Nadu, Tourism, Culture and Religious Endowments Department, having office at the Secretariat, Fort St. George, Chennai-600 009, I am the 1st Respondent in the above mentioned Writ Petition and as such I am well conversant with the facts of the case from the available records and circumstances of the case and competent to swear this affidavit. I have read the above writ petition and I am filing this counter affidavit in answer to the various averments that are contained in the affidavit filed in support of the above Writ Petition, and I deny all the averments made therein except those that are specifically admitted herein.  

2. I submit that the present Public Interest Litigation is brought by the petitioners herein before this Hon'ble Court challenging the Constitutional validity of sections 3(1), 3(4), 23, 24, 26, 32, 35, 36, 36-A, 36-B, 43-A, 45, 47, 49, 49-B, 50, 53, 54(1), 57, 58, 61, 63, and sections 71-76, 92, 97, 108, and 111 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (herein after referred to as the Tamil Nadu Act) as being ultra vires of Articles 14, 15(1), 19(1)(g), 21, 25, 26, 31(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of India so far as this 1st Contesting Respondent is concerned.  

3. I humbly submit that before traversing into the facts of the present case, this 1st Contesting Respondent felt it as necessary to submit before this Hon'ble Court about the intention, objects and reasons of Legislation in enacting the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Herein after referred as the "Tamil Nadu Act" for the sake of clarity and brevity).  

4. I submit that the said Tamil Nadu Act was enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu to amend and consolidate the law relating to the administration and governance of Hindu Religious and Charitable Institutions and Endowments in the State of Tamil Nadu. It is also submitted that the historical analysis of Government control over endowments has been given by Mr.  

---

P.R.Ganapathy Iyer in his book on “Law relating to Hindu and Mohammedan Endowments”, first published in 1915 and subsequently revised. It is most respectfully submitted that the learned Author has drawn reference to the decision in *Manohar Ganesh Tambeker Vs Lakshmiram Govindram* (1887) ILR 12 Bombay 247 (260) that under the native system of Government, though it was looked upon as a heinous crime to appropriate to secular purposes, the estate that had once been dedicated to pious purposes, yet the State in its secular executive and judicial capacity intervened to prevent fraud and waste in dealing with religious endowments. As regards the nature of the rights exercised by the Government, the learned author has referred to the observations in the Judgment of the Judicial Committee in *Raja Muthuramalinga Sethupathi Vs. Perianayagam Pillai* (1874) LR.II-A 209 at pages 232-233 that the British Government by virtue of its Sovereign power asserted, as the former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit endowments and to prevent and redress abuses in their management.

I submit that the sovereign authority of the State is being exercised over the religious institutions even in the ruling of ancient kings. There are evidences for the power exercised over the religious institution by Ancient Ruler of our Country, it included not only general supervision but also interference in management of the temple when they found mismanagement.

I submit that the proper maintenance of the temples and the due administration of their endowments have always been considered as one of the primary responsibilities of the State. In days of yore, under the Hindu Rule the then Kings (Rajahs) exercised through their officers real and direct control over all religious institutions and endowments. They had also endowed extensive properties for the maintenance, proper upkeep of the deities and the temple as Inam. The supervision of temple management was recognized in every native State to be one of the essential functions of the Government. Many of those institutions had been founded and endowed by their ancestors, and several of them continued to secure periodical pecuniary contributions from the State. Even under Muhammadan rule, this duty of the State was not completely ignored. The Hindu Rulers interfered in the administration of the temples whenever it was found that the managers abused their position.

I submit that after the advent of the British Rule, it was found that the income of many endowments was mis-spent and misappropriated by the persons in charge of the same and the British Government asserted the right of supervision over the endowed properties as was exercised by the former Rulers and in 1810 a Regulation was passed for Bengal. Similar Regulations for Madras and Bombay were made in 1817 and 1827 respectively. Under the Madras Endowments and Escheats Regulation No.VII of 1817, which came into force on 30th September,1817 (published in Tamil Nadu Code Vol.I), the general superintendence of all endowments in land or money granted for support (*inter-alia*) of Hindu temples or for pious or beneficial purposes vested in the Board of Revenue, which had to ensure that all such endowments are duly appropriated to the purpose for which they were destined by the Government or the individuals by whom such endowments were made and to prevent such endowments from being converted to the private use of individuals or otherwise misappropriated. The Board of Revenue was authorized to appoint local agents to achieve the objects. It was explained in Regulation 15, that the objects of the Regulations was solely to provide for the due appropriation of lands or other endowments agreeably to the intent of the grantor and not to resume any part of them or of their produce for the benefit of the Government.

I submit that the obvious effect and intention of this Regulation VII of 1817 were the continuance and maintenance of the policies that had been in vogue under the Hindu and Muhammadan Rulers. The Government recognized that it was a duty incumbent on them to keep a strict watch over religious trusts and endowments and gave effect to this principle by exercising control over the management of Hindu temples through their officers. This system of supervision continued up to 1839. After 1839, owing to the agitation set up by the Missionaries that it was not one of the functions of a Christian Government to administer Hindu Endowments and provide for the maintenance of Hindu Temples and Muhammadan Mosques, the Government management of Hindu and Muhammadan religious endowments was gradually withdrawn. As a result of this relinquishment of control and due to the inadequacy of checks provided by the general law, in the absence of an active supervising agency, gross mismanagement and misappropriation of temple funds became rampant. The evil grew from bad to

---

8  
worse until it came to a crisis about the year 1860 or 1861.  

6. I submit that the necessity for a supervising agency constituted by Law having been keenly felt, Regulation VII of 1817 was repealed and substituted by an Act of the Legislature viz., Act XX of 1863. Act XX of 1863 however repealed Regulation VII of 1817, presumably due to improper management in its working by local agents. Under this Act, some form of supervision was made by local temple committees formed there under, as the successor to the Board of Revenue under Regulation VII of 1817. These committees, however could and did not function properly owing to lack of inbuilt mechanism to enforce their orders. But the jurisdiction of these Committees was limited only to such temples, the nomination of the trustees of which was originally vested in Government or was subject to the confirmation of Government or of a public officer. Other temples which under Regulation VII of 1817 had been subject to the supervision of the Board of Revenue, continued to remain, even after the passing of Act XX of 1863 in the same uncontrolled state in which they had been between the years 1842 and 1862. Act XX of 1863 while it gave effect to the policy of severing the connection of Government  

9  
with the management of Hindu temples, made no provision for the exercise of any supervision over a large and important class of temples in whose case the trustees, though not originally hereditary, came to be treated as hereditary trustees after 1863, as though the temples had been under the management of the hereditary trustees from the very commencement. There were also other defects, which contributed to the inefficient working of the Act. There was several attempts made from time to time for the removal of the principal defects in the working of the Religious Endowments Act XX of 1863 which emanated for constitution of various Committees and drafting of Bills to the Government of India, and finally the subject was taken up in 1920 and the Charitable and Religious Trusts Act (XIV of 1920) was passed by the Imperial Legislature. It is submitted that the long-felt legislative measure was taken up in the Madras Presidency through the bold initiative of the Rajah Saheb of Panagal, then Chief Minister of the Government of Tamil Nadu, then in charge of the subject and Bill No.12 was introduced in the Madras Presidency Legislature in 1922 to repeal Act XX of 1863 and to codify the law in accordance with the requirements of the times. Accordingly, Act I of 1925 was passed into law and put  

10  
into force immediately. Under this Act, a Statutory Board called the Hindu Religious Endowments Board was constituted and the system of supervision and control over temples and maths was put into force. However, within a short period of the formation of the Hindu Religious Endowments Board objections were raised as to the validity of the enactment in the Tamil Nadu, several suits before the Hon'ble High Court was filed by certain leading Mattadhipathis and trustees of important temples. Pending suits, a fresh Bill repealing Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 1925 and re-enacting its provisions with a clause validating all acts done under Act 1 of 1925, was introduced in the Council in 1926, and this was passed into law and placed on the Statute Book as the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious Endowments Act of 1926 (Tamil Nadu Act II of 1927). Subsequently, various Acts, Act Nos.1 of 1928, V of 1929, IV of 1930, XI of 1931,XI of 1934, XII of 1935, XX of 1938, XXII of 1939, V of 1944, X of 1946, V of 1947, XIX of 1951 was passed and Provincialisation of the Department has been brought by the Government. Subsequently, repealing the earlier enactment the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act XXII of 1959) came to be passed by the Tamil Nadu  

11  
Government which received the assent of the President of India also.  

7. I submit that it is relevant to point out here that the Ministry of Law, Government of India (Legislative Department) under section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (60 of 1952) has also constituted a Commission of Inquiry called the Hindu Religious Endowments Commission for the purpose of making an enquiry into certain matters connected with Hindu Public Religious Endowments. The Commission in its report under Chapter X, the caption 'Irregularities and Malpractices' has pointed out that  

"A large number of witnesses have testified before us that many mahants and trustees have either alienated the property of the endowments to third parties or favoured dependents or nominees or treated such property as their own private property so that it may pass on to their own children or dependents. In addition it is also complained that these mahants and trustees have neglected the temples in their charge. We consider that it is quite necessary to ensure that funds belonging to Hindu Religious Endowments are not misappropriated by

---

12  
trustees or mahants and that the authority who is in charge of the Hindu Religious Endowments in each State should exercise the utmost vigilance in preventing such alienations or misappropriations and where alienations have already taken place, he should also take immediate action to have such alienations set aside and the alienated properties restored to the endowments concerned. Alienated property and its proceeds should be followed in the hands of the alienees who should be made accountable for the proceeds. The necessary machinery or tribunal for this purpose should also be devised....  

We trust and hope that the State Governments will call upon the Commissioners or other officers in charge of endowments within their States to make careful inquiries into these complaints and find out if they are true or exaggerated or false. We also trust that State Government will take very prompt action on the reports of the Commissioners or other officers concerned and ensure that such irregularities and malpractices are put an end to where they exist and do not recur in future. Where complaints made  

13  
against individuals are found to be substantially correct, steps should be taken to remove or suspend the delinquents. It is needless to emphasise that action taken at least against some prominent delinquents will not only tone up the administration but also create a wholesome impression on the public generally and the force of public opinion thus generated will, we are confident, act as a deterrent on incipient or potential delinquents.  

The Commission also gave suggestions for improvement of State Laws governing religious institutions.  

Therefore, it is submitted that taking the paramount interest of the Public Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments and properties attached thereto, the Government of the respective State have enacted Law on this subject.  

I further submit that the history of legislation became necessary as a result of the almost invariable mismanagement of the endowed property of the temple by the trustees, misappropriation of the funds of the endowments for purposes unconnected with the original aims and objects of such endowments utilization of funds  

14  
of the endowments by the trustees as manager for personal purposes etc. So by considering the above facts, there are valid reasons that necessitated for enactment of Law by the Competent Legislative Authority on this subject by the State Government as per the powers conferred under the Constitution of India.  

With regard to averments made in paragraph 8 of the Writ Petition, I submit that the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act never took away the internal autonomy of the Religious Institutions and denomination as alleged by the writ petitioners. It is submitted that under the framework of the Tamil Nadu Act, the Government has got administrative control over the religious institutions on their secular activities only and they do not interfere in religious matter except when in dispute. It is strongly denied that the authorities of the Department and the Government only after meeting with their approvals, money can be expended for conducting religious rites and rituals. It is submitted that in order to have a check and balance, approval is being given by the authorities under the Act on the proposals submitted by the trustees under section 58 of the Tamil Nadu Act. It is also submitted that neither the State Government nor the authorities under  

15  
the Tamil Nadu Act, imposes any restriction in conducting any religious rites and rituals in the temples, except to uphold the provisions of Law.  

With regard to averments made in paragraph 9 of the Writ Petition, I submit that the administration of a religious institution can never be compared with running of a Company, College, Hospitals etc. It is submitted that under Article 25 of the Constitution, it is specifically provided that-  

“(1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.  

(2) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any law-  
(a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice;  
(b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institution of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus. Therefore, under the framework of the Tamil Nadu Act, the Government and the authorities under the Act being the supervising  

---

16  
statutory authority may regulate or restrict any economic, financial or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice.  

10. With regard to averments made in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Writ Petition, I submit that the averment of the petitioner that temples are compelled to contribute 1/6th of the total gross income as contribution and audit fees is denied as false and incorrect. It is true that the Tamil Nadu Act was enacted to prevent mal-administration and mismanagement in the religious institutions. The Audit fees and contribution is levied as per section 92(1), 92(2) and collected from the religious institution as detailed below:  

# I Contribution  

| S.No | Assessable income               | percentage |
|------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1    | upto Rs.5000                    | Nil        |
| 2    | Rs.5001 to Rs.20,000            | 4 %        |
| 3    | Rs.20,001 to Rs.60,000          | 5%         |
| 4    | Rs.60,001 to Rs.2,00,000        | 6%         |
| 5    | Rs.2,00,001 to Rs.5,00,000      | 7%         |
| 6    | above Rs.5,00,000               | 12%        |

17  
# II Audit Fees  

| S.No | Assessable income               | percentage |
|------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1    | upto Rs.5,000                   | Nil        |
| 2    | Rs.5,001 to Rs.5,00,000         | 1.5%       |
| 3    | above Rs.5,00,000                | 4%         |

I further submit that the amount collected as contribution and audit fees are credited into the RELIGIOUS AND CHARITABLE ENDOWMENTS ADMINISTRATION FUND created under section 96 of the Tamil Nadu Act. The administrative expenses of this Department including pension contribution paid by the Government is debited to the Administrative Fund Account and also adequate provisions have been made in the Act to transfer any surplus available in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration fund to the Commissioner Common Good Fund. Further the Commissioner Common Good Fund is utilized for the renovation and preservation of needy temples and their buildings and paintings, for the promotion and propagation of tenets common to all or any class of religious institutions and for any of the purposes specified in sub-section (1) of section 66. Hence the averment of the writ petitioner that a sizable part of the income is being  

---

18  
taken away for non temple and non Hindu purposes is denied as false and frivolous.  

11. I submit that His Holiness Sri Vanamamala Ramanuja Jeer Swamigal represented by his Agent raised the issue of levying contribution or audit fees under section 92 of the Tamil Nadu Act, before this Hon'ble High Court of Madras in W.P.No.3203 of 1970. In the above writ petition, the Hon'ble court, by relying on the Hon'ble apex court judgment reported in A.I.R.1971 SC 344 held that  

"A levy in the nature of a fee does not cease to be of that character merely because there is an element of compulsion of coerciveness present in it, nor is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual services rendered by the authority to individual who obtains a benefit of service. If with a view to provide a specific service, levy is imposed by law and expenses for maintaining the service are met out of the amounts collected there being a reasonable relation between the levy and the expenses incurred for rendering the service, the levy would be in the nature of a fee and not in the nature of a tax".  

There is therefore, ample authority for the proposition that the contribution and audit fee demanded  

---

19  
by the Department is legal and is sustainable, in the eye of law as it is not a tax. The only test it should satisfy is that under the garb of collecting a fee, the Department should not collect exorbitant amounts which are absolutely unrelated or disproportionate to the services rendered by it to the relative institution as a whole. As already stated, it is not the service to a particular Mutt or institution that comes into judicial verdict for purposes of weighing the reasonableness or otherwise of such a fee. So long as the amounts collected by way of contribution, audit fee, costs etc. are all pooled up in a particular fund which is to be utilized for purposes of rendering service to all the religious institutions in the State without any discrimination whatsoever, then the only question is whether the totality of the collections made through a period gives the impression that it was only for aggrandizing the fund as such and such amounts so collected are so disproportionate to the nature, quality and character of services rendered to the institution.  

Finally, it was held as follows:-  

"As I am unable to agree with the contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioner and as the relief asked  

---

20  
for is one to direct the respondent to forbear from levying any contribution or audit fees under Sec.92 of the Act or to take coercive process in respect of the same, I am unable to grant the same. There has not been any violation of any public duty on the part of the respondent, when it levied the fee in accordance with the Act and in accordance with the prescribed scale and also when it involved Sec.94 of the Act, in default of payment of the demanded amount. The writ petition therefore fails and the same is dismissed but in the peculiar circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.

12. I further submit that a writ appeal was preferred against the above judgment in W.A.389/1974 and the same was dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras on 23.09.1994. The Hon'ble apex court also dismissed the Civil Appeal 1010/1975 filed against the Division Bench order of the High Court of Madras on 30.8.1990. Hence, the order becomes final.

13. Further I submit that in A.S.90/77, the Hon'ble High Court of Madras held as follows:

“Even in respect of a denominational temple, the authorities, under Tamil Nadu Act XXII of 1959 would have jurisdiction to levy contribution and audit fee. The denominational temples are not exempted from payment of audit fee or contribution. The learned counsel for the appellant faintly contended that no particular services had been rendered to this temple by the Departmental authorities, and that, therefore, there is no obligation to pay contribution or audit fee. This contention is a misconceived one. The contribution and audit fee are levied for the services rendered by the Department in the matter of superintendence of a temple. It is in exercise of such powers of superintendence that the accounts are audited and other services are ordered to all the temples. Therefore, it is not possible to relate the services to a particular temple to examine whether fees and contribution are payable by it. The contribution and audit fee would be leviable on any public temple of which this temple is one. It is not in dispute that the public have access to this temple. Even a denominational temple, so long as it is not a private one, would be liable to pay the contribution and audit fee. Therefore, except in the matter of declaration and any relief in consequence the rest of the reliefs cannot be granted to the plaintiff.”

14. With regard to the averments made in paragraph 12 of the Writ Petition, I submit that as per the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Act, the management of the religious institutions have been vested with the Trustees. The Executive officers are appointed only to assist the trustees and execute the resolutions passed by the Trust Board. Nowadays it is the order of the day to keep an eye with the public property as a threat of misappropriation is always there. The writ petitioner without specifying anything simply finding fault with the presence of officials in the administration. It is absolutely necessary to safeguard the immovable property of the religious institutions. During the settlement Inam and updating Revenue records settlement, Patta standing in the name temple or deity was changed to the Priest, Archagar, Poojari and Trustee of the temple and so many properties of religious institutions previously belonging to temples are now in the name of individuals.

15. With regard to averments made in paragraph 13 of the Writ Petition, I submit that the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, by various officers appointed under the Tamil Nadu Act is taking steps to retrieve the land to the religious institutions. Without any effective adjudication this is not at all possible and for which the Government machinery is absolutely necessary. According to the Writ Petitioner it is alleged that the history of the legislation since 1926 concerns the religious institutions, denomination etc. and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, the provisions of legislation relating to the administration and actions of the officers of the department under the cover of the said legislation reveals that consistent attempts are being made to usurp temples from traditional management. The Writ Petitioner also stated that several provisions of the 1951 Act were struck down as ultra vires the Constitution. But in reality the officers working under the department are preventing so many attempts made by the Trustees/Poojaries and legal heirs of Poojaries and other service holders.

16. With regard to averments made in paragraph 14 of the Writ Petition, I submit that section 45 of the Tamil Nadu Act has been enacted for better administration as well as management of the temple and also to check acts of mismanagement which may have been committed by any group of persons who have a role in the management of the temple. Section 107 of the Tamil Nadu Act specifically bars the application of the Act to institutions coming under the purview of or enjoying the protection under Article 26 of the Constitution of India. In other words, the Tamil Nadu Act has been passed protecting the rights of the religious denominations under Article 26 and

---

24  
excluding the said institution from the purview of the provisions of the Act including section 45 of the Tamil Nadu Act. As such, the ground taken by the petitioners that the provisions of section 45 of the Tamil Nadu Act are violative of the protection under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution is completely misplaced as the Act itself provides for the said contingency. In all cases, where Article 26 comes in, section 45 of the Tamil Nadu Act would automatically go out. Hence, section 45 of the Tamil Nadu Act is neither violative nor ultra vires the provisions of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that in the Shirur Mutt case reported in AIR 1954 SC 282, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has upheld section 58 of the Tamil Nadu Act XIX of 1951, while dealing with the Constitutional validity of section 58 of the Madras Hindu Religious and Endowments Act, 1951 which provided for framing of a scheme by a Deputy Commissioner in the interest of proper administration of the trust, in paragraph 35 of the judgment has observed as follows:  

> "35. The objection urged against the provision of CL.(3) (b) of S. 58 does not appear to us to be of much substance. The Executive Officer mentioned in that Clause could be nothing else but a manager of the properties of the Mutt and he cannot possibly be empowered to exercise the functions of the Maadthypathy himself. In any event, the trustee would have his remedy against such order of the Deputy Commissioner by way of appeal to the Commissioner and also by way of suit as laid down in Ss.61 and 62, Section 59 simply provides a scheme for the application of the 'cy pres' doctrine in case the object of the trust fails either from the inception or by reason of subsequent events. Here again the only complaint that is raised is, that such order could be made by the Deputy Commissioner. We think that this objection has not much substance. In the first place, the various objects on which the trust funds could be spent are laid down in the Section itself and the jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner is only to make a choice out of the several heads. Further an appeal has been provided from an order of the Deputy Commissioner under this Section to the Commissioner. We, therefore, cannot agree with the High Court that Ss. 58 and 59 of the Act are invalid".  

The provisions of section 58 are comparable to the provisions of section 45 of the present Tamil Nadu Act and as such, the above observations of the Supreme Court are very relevant in this regard.  

26  
17. I further submit that the powers of the Commissioner to appoint an Executive Officer and to define the powers and duties of the Executive Officer as also to take action against him are couched in legislative safeguards and do not give any room for exercise of unbridled or unguided power as alleged by the petitioners. Even under sub-section (4) of section 45 of the Tamil Nadu Act, where the Commissioner is entitled to take action against the Executive Officer, the phrase "for good and sufficient cause", would reflect that the Act envisages the compliance with the principles of natural justice before the Commissioner exercises his powers by imposing any punishment in the nature of suspension, removal or dismissal of the Executive Officer.  
section 45(4) is extracted below:  

> "(4) The Commissioner may, for good and sufficient cause, suspend, remove or dismiss the Executive Officer."  

18. With regard to averments made in paragraphs 23 to 43 of the Writ Petition, I submit that the petitioners made bald allegations against the State without any material of the documentary evidence. The Tamil Nadu Act has been enacted to ensure that Hindu Temples are endowments  

27  
which are properly administrated and their income is duly appropriated for the purposes which they were founded or exist. As averred by the writ petitioners the control of the Religious Institutions and the properties are not taken by the authorities under the Act but actually it has been vested with the trustees. The authorities under the Tamil Nadu Act are entrusted with the duty to prevent mismanagement and to ensure transparency and accountability in the administration of the properties of the Religious Institutions. It is totally denied that the properties are treated and appropriated as if they are the private properties of the Government but in practice the properties stand in the name of the idol and treated as property belonging to the minor idol.  

19. I further submit that the averments of the petitioners that the authorities are provided with vast powers to cut down the dittams either abridging or abrogating the Poojas and the ceremonies in the temple and make the practice of the religion dependent upon the will and pleasure of Governmental servants and the Government is denied as false and incorrect. But the expenditure statement scale of expenditure and proposal for fixing dittam shall be prepared by the trustees of the temple and submitted to the appropriate authority to ensure whether the same is

in confirmity with the requirements of the religious institutions as a check and balance.  

20. I further submit that necessary provision has been incorporated in the Tamil Nadu Act to fix the fair rent to the properties considering the prevailing market rental value in the locality where the property is situated and the same has been periodically revised by every 3 years. The amounts derived as income from the properties are being deposited in the Account created in the name of the minor idol.  

21. I further submit that as averred by the petitioners the temple are centers of music, dance and education. The inscriptions, copper plates, mural and stone carvings found in the temple are preserved with great care and expertise. In order to give advice on archaeological matters and expert opinion in the conservation, renovation and restoration works in the temples of heritage values an Archaeological Expert Committee have been constituted by the Government and a separate Committee has also been constituted for the restoration and maintenance of heritage painting and murals.  

22. I further submit that nowadays sufficient number of qualified persons are not available for the post of Archakas, Othuvar etc. Hence in order to provide training in the respective fields Othuvar training Schools, Thevaram training Schools, Veda Agama Padasala, Nathaswaram and Thavil training Schools are run by the temples. It is also pertinent to point out that the number of persons interested in taking this profession is comparatively very low.  

23. I further submit that the State or any authorities under the Tamil Nadu Act are not destroying autonomy of the religious institutions under the cover of adopting regulatory measures. The autonomy of the religious institutions is protected by vesting the management with the trust board which comprises philanthropist and religious minded persons.  

24. I further submit that certain restrictions have been imposed by the Act with regard to administration of properties and funds of the religious institutions and upon free exercise of religion. The State never interferes with the religious affairs of the religious institutions.  

25. I further submit that as stated by the writ petitioner minor institutions which have no properties and very little income are unable to perform daily poojas in the temples. Hence the State can provide financial assistance to atleast to do "Orukala Pooja" under the welfare scheme. That apart the State can also provide financial assistance for renovation in the case of necessity. It is also pertinent to point out that the most of the institutions were constructed by erstwhile kings and they endowed properties for the maintenance of the said institutions. Further they granted Inam to the service holders to do service to the temple. But the said properties and Inam lands were gradually alienated by the Villagers, Trustees and Service Inam holders and the Institutions were completely neglected by the Villagers and Trustees. Now, the State Government have granted Rs.6 Crore every year for the renovation of the said temples. The Central Finance Commission is also rendering financial assistance for renovating ancient temple without tampering their Heritage value. So far a sum of Rs 9.87 Crore sanctioned in 12th Finance Commission and a sum of Rs.90 Crore have been sanctioned by the 13th Finance Commission.  

26. I further submit that offerings made by the devotees are utilized in connection with the rituals, festivals and upkeep of the temple only. The income of the religious institutions are neither taken away by the Government nor diverted to non Religious Government expenditures.  

27. Further the validity of the section 92 of the Tamil Nadu Act has been upheld by this Hon'ble Court.  

With regard to the averments made in ground A, I submit that the impugned Act is passed only as per the recommendation of the committee and the said committee took into consideration all the relevant facts and made recommendations. Hence it is strongly denied that it is ultra vires and also in the teeth of earlier judgments of this Hon'ble Court. In fact the Act facilitates Article 14 by ensuring equal representation of all people irrespective of caste, the very purpose of providing equality to all Hindu in worship in Public Religious Institution and to prevent and redress abuses in management. Therefore the said Tamil Nadu Act is a provision to enforce right to equality and not against it. It is pertinent to mention that as per section 47 of the Tamil Nadu Act non Hereditary Trustees are appointed to all public religious institutions in the State of Tamil Nadu by the Government except in which Hereditary Trustees are available. As per section 47 (1)(iii)(c) of the Tamil Nadu Act, every board of trustees shall consist one member from Schedule Caste or Schedule Tribe and one woman member.

28. I further submit that section 106 of the Tamil Nadu Act prohibits the discrimination in distribution of Prasatham or Theertham. As per section 55 of the Tamil Nadu Act, all office holders servant of religious institution shall be filled up by the trustee and in section 55(2), specifically stated that no persons shall be entitled to appointment to any vacancy referred to merely on the ground that he is next in the line of succession to the last holder of office.

29. With regard to the averments made in ground B and C, I submit that the impugned Act of the Tamil Nadu is concerned, it only regulates the financial management of the Hindu temples otherwise unbridled powers will be exercised by the persons in management of the religious institution. It cannot be said as an infringement of rights guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. The financial control of a religious institution vest with the trustees absolutely and not with the Government. However in public interest the Government has issued guidelines for investment of public money. The expenditure statement, scale of expenditure and proposal for fixing Thittam in the institution shall be prepared by the trustees of the temple and submitted to the appropriate authority to ensure whether the same is in conformity to the requirement of the religious institution.

The appropriate authority, approves such proposal or returns for addition or deletion with reasons. The persons working in the temples are also Hindu citizens entitled to Constitutional right to life and it is necessary to pay them adequate and reasonable salary commensurate with their qualification and work. Section 107 of the impugned Act protects the rights of religious denomination and it states that nothing contained in the Act shall save as otherwise provided in section 106 and in clause 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, deemed to confer any power or impose any duty in contravention of the rights conferred on any religious denomination or any section thereof by Article 26 of the Constitution. The Tamil Nadu Act empowers the authorities under the Act to adjudicate disputes over the matters whether any person is entitled, by custom or otherwise, to any honour, emolument or perquisite in any religious institution; and what the established usage of a religious institution is in regard to any other matter. The above disputes are enquired by the Joint Commissioner who is qualified with a degree in law with sufficient Bar experience by following the Civil Procedure Code, The Evidence Act etc. Necessary appeal remedy have been provided in the Act to file an appeal by the aggrieved person before the competent Civil Court, High Court, Supreme Court.

30. With regard to the averments made in grounds D and E, I submit that it is strongly denied that the money from Religious Institution is transferred to public exchequer and utilized for purposes unconnected. All the receipts are being deposited in the account which stands in the name of religious institution. The said amounts are being appropriated for the expenditure related to the respective institutions and any surplus available are being invested in the name of the said religious institution. As far as State of Tamil Nadu is concerned even a single pie belonging to any religious institution are not taken away to the public exchequer. The surplus fund from financially sound temple are diverted to implement various schemes to assist the poor and needy temples like, 'Orukala Pooja scheme,' 'Village Temples Renovation Scheme' and 'Tiruppani of temples' in the habitations of Adi Dravida and Tribal Communities. Therefore, the surplus fund available in financially sound temples is being utilized only for the purpose connected with Hindu Religious Institutions.

31. With regard to the averments made in ground F, I submit that as far as the State of Tamil Nadu is concerned the appointment of non Hereditary Trustees is being done only as per the provisions of the Act. As far as the scheme of administration available while appointing trustees, due regard is given to the claims of the persons belonging to the religious denomination for whose benefit the institution is chiefly intended or maintained and appointment of trustees is being made only as per the provisions of the scheme.

32. With regard to the averments made in ground G, I submit that as stated earlier the impugned Act was passed by the Government to safeguard the interest and properties of the public religious institution and to prevent mismanagement and maladministration by the local public. The reading of the history of legislation will show that time and again there has been improper management of lands and other endowments initially by the committee appointed by the Board of Revenue in 1817, which was repealed by the Act XX of 1863 to bring in local temple committees. These committees, however could and did not function properly owing to lack of inbuilt mechanism to enforce their orders. As a consequence, Madras Hindu Religious Endowments Act II of 1927 was passed with
